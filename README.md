# Root
**Root** allows you to create and navigate a private network of data easily.
you can view and save data to a **tree**, which originates from the **root**, which is you.
Every data you store revolves around nothing else but YOU.

# Features
* Cross-platform PWA(Progressive Web App).
* Simple and clean features and GUI. Nothing to add or subtract.
* Highly customizable visual. A single CSS file can set up the entire theme and layout.

# What is it?
You can think it as a 
* filesystem
* that stores each pieces of data to link themselves to each other
* where you can navigate the data by those links
* as if you were browsing a website, 
* exploring further by clinking to links
* and those data you save is local
* but you can sync it by involving third-party cloud service, such as Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive.
There is no self-made backend service that syncs data to a server for this app. So users can adopt reliable cloud services they already purchased.

# What's unique?
Root is intended to differ from other apps.
* I compare Root and pre-existing note apps, blog services, and filesystems.
* They supports only limited methods of creating network of data. Creating and exploring a network has never been the primary objective.
* You can link pieces of data via hypertext, but you cannot view the network itself comprehensively. What you see is the each nodes, not the wires.
* And since the atomic unit of stored data is a page, it is hard or feels misfitting to link a word, a sentence, an image or a file to one another.
* Root allows you to create and navigate a private network of data easily.

# The Experience 
**Root** is designed to give you an experience that is
* **clean** (minimal GUI, concealed details),
* **fast** (very simple data transaction),
* and **trustworthy** (things barely go wrong when what you do is simple).
